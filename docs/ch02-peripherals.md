# Understanding Common Peripherals, Interfaces and Connectors
There are so many different peripherals that can be attached to a computer, each with its own unique interface (meaning how it can be used by the computer and programmer or user). Some peripherals functions are more specific while others are capable of multitasking.

## Audio and Video Devices
Audio devices are devices that are connected to the audio ports available through the sound 	card. Depending on the function of the device, the device could be connected to a different color-coded port. i.e. If a mic was to be connected to a computer it would be connected to the green 3.5 mm port.

When it comes to Video Devices there are a host of them that can be connected to your 	computer. i.e. CRTs, Projectors, Flat screens and Touch screens.

**Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)** is a legacy device, which uses an electron gun to shoot a beam of electrons at the back side of the monitor screen. Their image quality is measured in 2 ways: *Dot Pitch* and *Resolution*.

**Dot Pitch** determines how sharp the picture can be, which is measured in millimeters.

**Resolution** is measured by the how many software picture elements are used to draw the screen. Resolution is measured in a ratio of row and columns called Pixels. These pixels are illustrated by both the column and row numbers.

Projectors produce a lighted image and display it many feet away from the system. A projector is susceptible to ambient light (other light sources while projecting). Brightness levels of the projector, counteracts this problem.
-	A projectors quality is measured by how bright it is, that brightness is measured in *Lumens*.
-	Flat screens are much thinner, lighter and consume less power than CRTs. There are 3 different versions of Flat-screens: *Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)*, *Light-Emitting Diode (LED)* and *Plasma*.
-	LCD uses current which allows light (generated by a fluorescent tube) to pass through two polarized filters which are between liquid crystals.
-	LED uses the same technology as an LCD however, the light source is the difference, the light source comes from an LED instead of a fluorescent tube.
-	Plasma use small cells containing electrically charge ionized gases i.e. ‘neon’ to display images. The downside with plasma TV is that they wear out quicker than their LCD or LED and the tend to burn images into the screen.

Touchscreen displays allow the user to input data by touching the screen, which would mimic the actions of a mouse pointer clicking on a selected item. Cleaning touchscreens with glass cleaner can ruin the screen, due to the special coating that is used to make the screen. The best method to clean a touchscreen would be to use a damp cloth with water.

There are many different types of Video connectors that are associated with these devices mentioned. Examples of popular connectors are *Video Graphics Array (VGA)*, *Digital Visual Interface (DVI)*, *Universal Serial Bus (USB)*, *High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)*, *DisplayPort*, *Mini DisplayPort* and *Thunderbolt*.

Based on what your needs are and the graphics card you use there would be one of these ports placed on either your graphics card or your device (laptop).
-	**VGA** also referred to as a Generic Analog Video connector is a 15-pin video connector, that takes in analog signals only and is typically blue in color.
-	**DVI** connectors are known to support both analog and digital signals. The port and its connector typically colored white.
-	**USB** transmit video data digitally and can power the devices that connect through that port i.e.  Connecting a portable monitor through USB.
-	**HDMI** is a 19-pin connector that has very fast transfer speeds, which supports digital data only. This connector is capable of transmitting Audio, Video, network connectivity and provide power to the devices.
-	**DisplayPort** is intended for video devices only, but can transmit audio and video at the same time. This connector was meant to replace the VGA and DVI however it was toppled by the HMDI connector.
-	**Thunderbolt** was developed by Apple as an offshoot of the DisplayPort along with the Mini Display Port. This port not only supports video, but several other devices can be connected to the same port.

Adjusting and Configuring displays requires making sure that the monitor is connected to the device, installing the driver and configuring the devices resolution settings through the monitor itself or using the software that is provided by the manufacture. On laptops you may have to adjust the monitor by using the function keys identified by Fn.

## External Storage and Communications Connectors
External Storage devices have been around before internal storage existed. Today we have different types of devices that we use to store data externally. i.e. *Flash Drives*, *Memory Cards*, *External Hard Drives*, *External Optical Drives* and *Network Attached Storage (NAS)*.
-	**Flash Drives** also known as thumb drives, have replaced the floppy drives due to their compact size, speed, capacity and simplistic use. These drives typically use USB connectors to plug in and use Flashing technology to store data to and from a computer device.
-	**Memory Cards** also use flashing technology to store and save data however they look different from their thumb drive counterparts and they also require a memory card reader port if data is to be read from the drive.
-	Memory card readers comes in three prominent standards: **Smart Media**, **Compact Flash** and **Secure Digital (SD)**.
-	Memory card are typically inserted into devices such as digital cameras, printers and video cameras due to their thin size.
-	**External Hard Drives** are basically the same thing as an internal hard drive except, they are enclosed in a protective case and connects via an external connector. These drives typically come in either as an HDD or SSD.
-	Connections and connectors typically associated with External Hard Drives are: USB, FireWire, eSATA and or Thunderbolt.
-	External Optical Drives are drives that work similar to their internal counterparts however they are designed to work externally and use connectors such as USB, FireWire, eSATA and or Thunderbolt.
-	NAS is a hard drive that is attached to the network. Some of the added benefits of having a NAS are allowing multiple drive to be attached together, hot swapping of the drives should one fail and   built-in fault tolerance (which protects data if one drive fails).
-	Connectors used to connect a NAS are USB, FireWire, eSATA for direct connectivity, and or connecting through the Network wired (RJ45) or wirelessly.
-	External Storage Connectors come in different shapes and sizes, some examples include: USB, eSATA, FireWire and Thunderbolt.
-	USB have many different upgrades that have been made to them in order to support the demands for higher data transfer speeds. USB supports 127 devices on a since port.
-	eSATA works the same as its SATA counterpart, however it has been designed to connect externally from the chassis. The ‘e’ in SATA stands for external. This connector can support 15 devices on a single bus.  Other variations of this port allow power through the cable i.e eSATA+, eSATAp, eSATA/USB.
-	FireWire developed by Apple as a method to engineer a connector capable of high speeds. This connector is also known as IEEE 1394, FireWire and iLink. FireWire can achieve transfer speeds up to 3.2 Gbps and can connect up to 63 devices on a single bus. FireWire was later replaced with Thunderbolt connector in 2014.
-	Thunderbolt replaced FireWire due to its reliable data transfer and high-speed throughput reaching speeds up to 40 Gbps, while consuming less power.
-	Communication Connectors use two types of cords for all wired networking connections i.e. RJ45 for computer networks and RJ11 for telephone lines.
-	Registered Jack 45 (RJ45) also known as Ethernet cable. This cable has eight leads on the connector and has a max speed of 10Gbs.
-	RJ11 also know as a telephone cable often has two pairs of wires but only is used. The maximum data transfer rate for these cables are 40Kbps, which is significantly less than RJ45.

## Input and Output Devices
Even though we live in a decade in which AI is on the rise, computers can’t do anything until they are given input telling them what to do. Providing output is also a critical function to computers, because it shows the computers response to the user’s commands or input.

There are two common types of input device a Keyboards and a Pointing device i.e. Mouse. A common output device is a Printer. These devices come with many different variations that we will break down below.

-	Keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes i.e. the standard and ergonomic (prevent injury) keyboard. The most common keyboard configuration for Latin script Languages is called QWERTY and DVORAK, which places letters in better spots to increase typing speed. Keyboards use connectors such as USB and PS/2 (which is known as a legacy connector).
-	Five different types of pointing devices commonly used today are Mouse, Touchpad, Joystick, Stylus Pen and Trackball.
-	Mouse a small handheld device that is dragged across a solid surface to move the cursor on a computer screen.
-	Touchpad allows the user to use move the cursor by using your finger, and will often have two buttons, one for left and another for right clicking.
-	Joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports it angle direction to the computer, which would move the cursor.
-	Stylus pen is an input device that resembles a pen, which is used to enter commands on a touch screen.
-	Trackball is an inverted mouse with a ball. The ball is exposed and you roll it around with your thumb and/or fingers.

Connecting pointing devices typically consist of USB and PS/2. These pointing devices come up with a few configuration options i.e. choosing default hand, cursor response speed and button mapping.

Printers are output devices that are used to put information from the computer onto paper. There are several different technologies used to get an image o n paper, however there are two most common printing technologies used today, the inkjet and laser printer.
-	Inkjet printers spray ink on the page to form the image. They intake an ink cartridge, which is a small plastic container that holds the liquid ink the printers use to create images. Their cartridges are commonly referred to as CMYK cartridges.
-	Laser printers use a dry powdery plastic resin called toner, which is stored in a replaceable toner cartridge. These printers are generally bigger, faster and more expensive than inkjet printers.
-	Multifunctional or all in one printer are printers that have additional features added to them, allowing the printer to be both an input and output device. These printers can come as one of the several different printer technologies as their primary output of course.
-	Connecting printers allows the computing device to be able to send Jobs to the printer. Connections used to connect the printer are Serial, parallel, USB and Network.
-	Serial is a 9-pin connector that sends data serially meaning 1 bit at a time, one after another. This technology is considered a legacy technology.
-	Parallel is 25-pin connector typically colored pink, that receives data 8 bits at a time over eight separate wires (a bit for each). This technology is also considered legacy.
-	USB is the most common connector type that you will see used with primary printers today.
-	Network connection is a popular choice in business because it allows the printer to be shared within an office. Connecting the printer could be done wired via RJ45 or wireless.

## Understanding Installation Basics
When installing devices there isn’t a simple answer because a lot of it depends on the type of device you’re connecting. Common devices that require connection could either be internal or external.
-	Internal devices are devices that go inside of the case. When installing the device, the user has to make sure that the computer or case is powered off. Next is placing the right component on the right slot, then turn the computer on install the driver or any software that the component may come with for full functionality.
-	External devices are devices that are outside the case, these do require to power from the computer or case. These devices typically take advantage of the plug and play feature, which allows the OS to automatically install the driver and configure all the settings of the device.
-	IP and Web-based Devices are the only peripherals that will require IP or Web-based devices for installation. (Review text for more information.)

## Reviewing Connector Types
Have students use Table 2.3 on Chapter 2 for more information on the different connectors and their specifications in terms of data transfer and perhaps throughput.

# Summary
This chapter covered the different peripherals devices and the connectors that come with each peripheral. We also looked at the various changes in the connectors as the demand for higher transfer rates became the norm along with the evolution of the devices that came along. In the next chapter we are going to look at newer computing devices and the Internet of Things.
