# Exploring Common Computing Devices
There are several different types of common computing devices and some are bigger than others. Although this chapter may not cover all of the different types of computers, it will attempt to give you a good understanding of the similarities and differences between different types of devices in the market place.

## Servers and Workstations
There are two different types of computing devices on the market, that you will commonly find 	on a network: servers and workstations. A network is a collection of computers and other 	devices connected together somehow to share resources i.e. Printers, data files, etc.
-	**Servers**, serve resources to network users, by centralizing control of resources (data) and security, thereby reducing administrative difficulties. Serves are categorized either as Dedicated or Nondedicated.
-	**Dedicated servers** are assigned to provide specific applications or services for the network and nothing else i.e. Web server is dedicated to the task of serving up web pages and nothing else.
-	**Non-Dedicated servers** are assigned to provide one or more network services and local access for a user i.e. a dedicated server might serve out one or more websites, whereas a non-dedicated web server, server out websites but might also function as a print server on a local network, or as the administrator’s workstation.
-	**Workstations** are computers which network users do their work, performing activities such as word processing, database design, graphic design, email and other office or personal task, i.e. they are basically everyday computers, except for the fact that they are connected to a network that offers additional resources.

## Laptops
Laptops were built to be portable computers meaning they were capable of doing everything a desktop computer can. Typical laptops contain a built-in keyboard, pointing device and LCD screen in a clamshell design.
-	Laptop Architecture is similar to that of a desktop in the sense that they have many parts that perform similar functions. The biggest difference would be the size - meaning that they are much smaller than their desktop counterparts. This presents one primary issue - heat management.
-	Working with Laptop Hardware is complex, because it’s hardware is proprietary, to replace a part, you need to use the a component built specifically for that laptop.
-	External Power Adapters promote laptop portability. Getting an additional power supply is recommended due to the fact that, power adapters are easily replaceable (just be sure to get one that compatible with laptop).
-	Docking Stations allows users to have additional slots (Ports) to expand the capabilities of their laptop, and to easily use a laptop in a "desktop" setting (external keyboard, mouse, and monitor)
-	Cable Locks such as the Kensington Lock also known as the K-lock is used to physically secure your laptop from theft by attaching it to a desk or table.
-	Working with Laptop Interfaces, input devices are designed to be significantly different than their desktop counterparts.
-	Keyboards on laptops are meant to provide as much functionality as possible. For this reason, they come with a Function (Fn) to expand the capabilities of limited number of keys on the keyboard.
-	Pointing Devices come in many different versions and designs, some of which are mentioned bellow. Why? Because it only makes sense to do so.
-	**Trackball** is essentially the same as a mouse upside down. This technology was used on the early computers.
-	**Touchpad is** a device that has a small panel containing different touch-sensitive areas.
-	**Point Stick** a pointing device that uses a small rubber-tipped stick. When pushed in a particular direction, the on-screen pointer (Cursor) goes in the same direction.
-	**Touchscreen** a display device in which allows the user to interact with a computer by touching areas on the screen.

## Tablets and Smartphones
In the world of mobile devices nothing compares to the mobility of tablets and smartphones. Although both devices have so much in common such as similar OS and capabilities, one difference is their function. Tablets are much bigger than mobile devices. They are meant to serve as a laptop replacements and mobile devices are simply to replace the standard wired telephone.
-	Comparing and contrasting Mobile Devices can be difficult because these devices share so much in common. There are two common OS’s that you discover when working with Mobile devices, iOS (Apple) and Android (Google). All mobile devices are not field replaceable, if they break the whole unit needs to be replaced. Due to the fact that the MOBO of this device is very small, when compared to Laptops, Desktops, etc. the hardware can be very limited.
-	Using Mobile Devices in twenty first century may seem like the trendiest thing to do, whether you like the trend or not, it is imperative as a technician to know how to configure and troubleshoot these devices.  
-	Using Mobile Device Interfaces could not afford the addition of a keyboard and a mouse as input devices due to their size, which is why the touch screen and on-screen keyboard became a new tool to input information.
-	Working with Mobile device Touchscreens can be daunting when it comes to memorizing all the gestures. Gestures is a concept in which the user, use their fingers and various movements to interact with their touchscreen. There are three common gestures are tap, swipe, pinch and fourth is related to kinetics.
-	**Tapping** allows a finger taping on the screen to act as a mouse clicking.
-	**Swiping** allows to mover pages or scroll up or down.
-	**Pinching** allows either to zoom in (two fingers apart and then pinching them together) or out (placing fingers together and then slowly spreading them apart).
-	**Kinetics** Allow the device to have a sense of motion by using sensors such as the accelerometer (location) and gyroscope (screen orientation).
-	Screen Orientation allows the capability of the screen to be oriented from landscape to portrait through the use of the gyroscope. However, applications much have that feature programmed within them, to take advantage of that built in feature.
-	Mobile Locking and Security is critical since these devices can easily be stolen. To avoid thieves from interacting with the stolen device users are typically required to enter a passcode, a four-digit number or use their finger print for biometric authentication.
-	Configuring Network Connections is pretty straight forward, buy it, charge it, turn it on, follow the prompts and connect it to your cellular provider.
-	Setting up a Wi-Fi connection can be a tricky, however you want to make sure that your mobile device can connect to Wi-Fi. Connecting to Wi-Fi on most mobile devices requires that you go through the settings menu, clicking on the Wi-Fi symbol, identifying the SSID of the network you wish to connect to and entering the password if prompted to.
-	Configuring Bluetooth is almost similar to connecting to Wi-Fi, you simply have to identify the device you wish to pair to and then pair them. Bluetooth pairing is the process in which two Bluetooth devices communicate with each other.
-	Using Airplane mode isn’t about setting connections, it’s mostly about disconnecting the device from all the networks. Additional benefits from engaging Airplane mode is to conserve battery life.
-	Getting Apps and Synchronizing expand the capabilities of your device and add protection to its data.
-	Getting additional apps or application (Programs) on mobile devices couldn’t be any simpler. For iOS devices it’s through iTunes App Store and for Android devices it’s through Android’s Google Play app.
-	Configuring Synchronization options has two benefits it allows the user to have access to their files online or from your device and it provides a backup of your file in case you need to restore your device. Activating syncing is simply done through your system settings.

## Gaming Consoles
A gaming console is a computer with a single, specialized purpose: to play games through the use of a special input device called a controller. Gaming consoles are also capable of web surfing, playing movies on Blue-ray or DVD.
-	A Quick History of Gaming Consoles didn’t come into existence until the 1970s with the Magnavox Odyssey. In the late 1970 and early 1980s color graphics and sound were introduced. Controllers became more sophisticated and games became more complex. Nintendo Entertainment System was introduced in 1983 and was the first popular console. Then Sony 1994 took over the market with the PlayStation. Microsoft introduced the Xbox in 2001, then Nintendo came out with the Wii in 2006 which was novel because its controller could also detect player movements in three directions.
-	Current Gaming Consoles include Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Sony continued on with the PlayStation series, Microsoft with the Xbox series, however Nintendo decided to reinvent their device by introducing the Switch. Both PlayStation and Xbox consoles do not have any room for upgrading (except the hard drive) due to the devices form factor. The Switch is different from both devices, its smaller and its portable meaning it can be connected to a TV and also be detached from its dock and played portably.

# Understanding the Internet of Things
The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is the network of devices that are able to communicate with each other and exchange data. These THINGS can be a hardware device, software, data or even a service.

## A Brief History of the Internet of Things
The term Internet of Things was coined in 1999, even though the concept was still underdeveloped. Through the advancement in the technology landscape in 2012, devices had become smaller and cheaper, coupled with broadband internet becoming common and global communications nearly instantaneous, it was clear that the time to re-introduce the term Internet of Things had arrived.

## Consumers Uses
With multiple devices in your home are IoT-enabled, the home owner has control of these devices through a centralized hub regardless of their location, it is clear that these IoT devices were produced for consumers.
-	Household Uses have become the largest segment for all IoT devices in market today with devices such as Home Entertainment Systems, Thermostats, Appliances and Security systems.
-	**Home Entertainment Systems** or "Smart TVs" I.e. High-Definition TV with built-in wireless networking and the ability to connect to streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.
-	**Thermostats** which are programmable, allowing the user to set the temperature based on the time and day the user has been around remotely.
-	**Appliances** such as refrigerators that would warn you if you are out of milk or if you want to have milk be automatically added to your next grocery list.
-	**Security systems** are the second largest market when it comes to smart home device. These devices include, doorbell cameras, IP cameras, Motion sensors, gas, smoke detectors, door locks, garage door openers and lighting controls, which also can be controlled through your Mobile Phone.

Other Consumer Uses are for devices that work outside the home I.e. Modern Cars, Fitness and Health Monitors.
-	**Modern Cars** come with other modifications to them such as connecting to your network, having additional sensors added to them allowing the vehicle to adapt to terrain, get smarter by learning driving behavior and be capable of self-driving.
-	**Fitness** and **Health Monitors** are popular for people who want to keep track of their exercise, calorie consumption and heart rate. Most come as smartwatches and can connect to devices through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Cellular, collecting user data and transmitting it other devices.

## Commercial Uses
Industries can benefit from interconnected devices; such benefits would allow industries to understand their clientele better and also intelligently utilize their resources.
-	Medical Devices can benefit by allowing different devices to share data and also allow off site monitoring of patients, which would allow patients mobility and medical professionals flexibility when observing them. For example, devices such as a pacemaker can be connected to a smart system which would monitor a patient’s vital signs and alert medical professionals if there is a problem.
-	Manufacturing plants can have sensors built into them allowing machines to alert Technicians when they need to be maintained or if they need to be fixed or a part needs to be replaced.
-	Transportation would benefit from this technology by allowing truck to drive themselves, traffic lights to smoothen traffic by having sensors and GPS navigators re-route drivers to better routes avoiding rush hour and congestion.
-	Infrastructure could benefit from such technology, for example, putting sensors into concrete and metal structures within bridges to monitor stress and the strain their under, preventing potential tragedies.

## Potential Issues 
Although these devices do come with a tremendous potential, there are also some other drawbacks, for example how the devices connect to other devices and whether there are securities build into the devices as they are accessed.
-	Standards and Governance have not been implemented on communication and usage of these devices meaning the is not one specific standard or governing body for the Internet of Things. Having no governance presents communication issues and interoperability amongst different devices.
-	Data Security and Privacy can be compromised when using these devices. There are no guarantees that data security by remaining confidential, accessible and not manipulated. Data privacy is another concern, meaning we are not aware whether the data being collected is being used appropriately or not.
-	Data Storage and Usage of massive quantities of data generated poses a potential security risk. We are not sure what companies do with that all that data from a consumer’s point of view. However, companies that a mine data and translate it effectively into actionable insights will be ahead of the curve as compared to their competitors.

# Summary
In this chapter various computing devices were brought up and others were introduced. The benefits of some devices were brought up, the potential security risks they would bring and whether we have control over the data that is being collected on us.
