### 1.6 - Explain the troubleshooting methodology 
- Identify the problem 
  - Gather information 
  - Duplicate the problem, if possible 
  - Question users 
  - Identify symptoms 
  - Determine if anything has changed 
  - Approach multiple problems individually 
- Research knowledge base / Internet, if applicable 
- Establish a theory of probably cause 
  - Question the obvious 
  - Consider multiple approaches (divide and conquer)
- Test the theory to determine the cause 
  - Once the theory is confirmed (confirmed root cause), determine the next steps to resolve the problem
  - If the theory is not confirmed, establish a new theory or escalate
- Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects 
- Implement the solution or escalate as necessary 
- Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventative measures 
- Document findings / lessons learned, actions and outcomes
